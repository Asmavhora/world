  <h1>My Favorite Person</h1>
  <p>This world is full of stress and anxiety now a days every person feels anxiety and stress but all problems has there solutions
    in every one lifes there is one important person must be there with that person we can share our every problems and we like to talk with them that person is like that if we not say anything than also he or she can understand our feeling
  in the same way my dad was important person in my life but before 3 years he passed away.But always remember that if god takes someone from your life it doesn't meant that god doesn't love u he is tasting you and always remember that god test only those person who are very close to him.
 After my dad's death i feel like my life gets over but still we r leaving.My sister Afrin vhora support a lot she take care of ours like my dad.After 2 years we came America here also my brothers and sisters are taking care of ours.
 At last i would like to say that never ever get close to anyone because if that person will not be always with us.Trust the mercy of Allah.</p>
